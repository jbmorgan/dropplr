# dropplr
dropplr is an idea for a game that I had but never had the time to finish.

Balls fall down. Poke the balls. They disappear. You get points!

## To Do
1. Figure out exactly how modifiers should behave.
2. Main menu screen.
3. Game over screen.
4. Game center integration.
5. More ball types.
6. Sound effects.
7. Music.
8. Tutorial.
